#  Tweet Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning

##  Overview

This project focuses on classifying tweet sentiment using traditional machine learning techniques. By preprocessing text and applying models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, we aim to determine whether a tweet expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

---

##  Objective

To build and evaluate machine learning models that can effectively classify the sentiment of tweets based on their textual content.

---

##  Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle / Public Tweet Dataset
- **Features**:
  - `text`: Raw tweet content
  - `label`: Sentiment class (`positive`, `negative`, `neutral`)

---

##  Preprocessing

- Tokenization
- Lowercasing
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization
- Vectorization using TF-IDF

---

##  Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (optional extension)
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

---

##  Results

- **Logistic Regression** performed best with ~85% accuracy.
- Naive Bayes was slightly faster but slightly less accurate.
- SVM showed potential but was computationally intensive without tuning.

---

##  Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy
- Pandas / NumPy

---

##  Conclusion

Traditional ML models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, when paired with robust preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization, offer strong performance in tweet sentiment classification tasks.
